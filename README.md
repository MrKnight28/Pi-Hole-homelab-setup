# Pi-Hole-homelab-setup
Network-wide Ad Blocker Running On A Raspberry Pi 4 
Hardware 4GB RAM 32GB MicroSD , GiGABIT Etherbet
Base OS - Rasperry Pi Os Desktop edition *came pre installed* Swapped to CLI mode once Pi-Hole was up


Set up the PI-Hole in October 2025 running 24/7 since due to privacy concerns and wanting to have a little fun.

I first purchased the Pi from ThePIhut *great customer service highly reccomend*
The SD card already came flashed which was great but if you are needing to flash yourself its nice and simple grab yourself a 16GB or 32GB microSD with and adaptor load up Balena Etcher Software click flash and select the RasperryPi OS image *.img file* found on the Rasperbby PI Website then slam it in the Pi and away you go with the setup
